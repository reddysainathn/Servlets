			--Set of Interfaces are same
JDBC Classes::
	--Set of classes which implement JSBC API Interfaces--In this classes wo got a code to connect to the DB server and interact with it.
	--Every DB vendor will provide the JDBC drivers to connect to their respective DB servers

Driver Manager::
	It is mainly responsible for managing JDBC drivers
	JDBC drivers have to register with the Driver Manager
	Driver Manager will use appropriate JDBC drivers to connect to the servers
